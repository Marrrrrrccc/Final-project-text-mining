Graduation Speech
Thank you (name of person who introduced you) .
[Look around the room.] Graduates . . . family members . . . and staff, it is an honor
to be part of this celebration, the (number) graduation ceremony at (name)
School.
It is such a pleasure to share in the intensity of emotions filling this (auditorium,
stadium) as you who are graduating close this chapter of your life’s story.
Parents, you are probably wondering where the years have gone. As you marvel
at your sons’ and daughters’ accomplishments, it doesn’t seem that long ago when
these young adults we honor today were toddling off to start kindergarten.
Of course, living through those years between kindergarten and graduation may
have seemed like an eternity for the students . . . and for some parents as well.
[Look at graduates.] You are the Class of 2010. You graduate in a century still in its
infancy . . . at a time in history when our world is dealing with enormous challenges
. . . but at a time when the opportunities created by those challenges have never been
greater.
You are technology natives . . . born and educated in a technological world that
was only found in science fiction stories when many of us in this room were in school.
You Twitter and tweet . . . read books and news on line . . . and your electronic social
networking has shrunk the known world.
